# Execution engine

Chalk'it execution engine implements a synchronous/reactive scheduling algorithm.

DataNode instances are the nodes of a direct acyclic graph where edges are data dependencies. They each own a *status* describing their latest execution state. *Last update* time indicates the time of the last successful execution.

## DataNodes status

May have one of the following values :

* *None* : execution of the dataNode has not happened yet.
* *Pending* : execution of the dataNode is pending. This happens when a web-service call takes some time to complete.
* *OK* : last execution of the dataNode has completed sucessfully.
* *Error* : last execution has completed with error.

## Execution rules

* DataNode is executed if and only if all its predecessors completed their execution with an *OK* status.
* Every time a dataNode is succesfully computed (status "OK"), it triggers the execution of all its successors.
* Graph execution is interrupted at dataNodes with an *Error* status. Their successors are not executed.

## Schedule instance

* At first start, graph is scheduled in a breadth-first order starting from source nodes. This is the first schedule instance.
* Some dataNodes might be updated through different ways : widget value written to dataNode, file imported into dataNode, formula modification, user refresh of dataNode... Such update launches the execution of the corresponding dataNode and a new scheduling instance.

## Execution flow control parameters

The graph execution is controlled by the execution flow control parameters specified in dataNodes.

### autostart

When set to *false*, the associated dataNode is not executed on first execution of the dashboard nor in subsequent ones.

Otherwise, i.e. when set to *true*, default dataNodes execution behavior applies: all nodes are executed by the Chalk'it runtime when all their predecessors successfully completed.

For example, **autostart** can be set to *false* to avoid executing a heavy computation web-service at project load.

Default value is true.

### sample time

* When different from 0, the dataNode is executed every *sample time*. It's useful for ensuring a periodic real-time execution behavior.
* Every time a non null sample time is defined, the execution engine computes the greatest common divisor and use it as a its base timer.

Sample time is expressed in seconds and must be a multiple of 0.1s. Default value is 0.

### explicit trig

* When set to *true*, the dataNode, in terms of execution flow control, is considered as a source node with autostart set to *false*. It is no longer executed when a direct predecessor is updated. With this setting, it is only executed when it is explicitly triggered by an associated  [push button](../../wdg/wdg-basic-inputs/#push-button) widget or by a click on the dataNode update icon ![Update](img/refresh-icon.png "Update") present in the dataNodes list of tabs 1 or 3. Please refer to the [Triggered POST](../../ds/ds-reference/#triggered-post) example above.
* Otherwise (i.e. when set to *false*), default dataNodes execution behavior applies. Useful for implementing a form-like behavior (setting independently all required dataNode inputs, without executing it with each update, then explicitly triggering its execution).

Default value is false.

### Execution flow control parameters : summary

The table below summarizes the *execution flow control parameters* for the currently available dataNode types in Chalk'it. Of course, data flow dependency induces an execution flow dependency, except when explicit trig is used.

A checkbox in the table indicates that the property can be customized by the user (true or false). Otherwise, they have the default value indicated above.

## DataNodes capabilities

In addition to execution flow control parameters, dataNodes may have common capabilites depending on their type.

### setInput with formula

Python or JavaScript code can be written to define input to dataNode computation.

### setValue from widget

Currently only [Variable](../../ds/ds-basics/#variable) dataNodes have this property. It indicates that their workspace value can be modified by widgets that have write capabilities (such as sliders ([horizontal slider](../../wdg/wdg-basic-inputs/#horizontal-slider) ...), [value](../../wdg/wdg-basic-inputs/#value), editable [table](../../wdg/wdg-basic-inputs/#table) ...).

### setValue from file

The value of the dataNode can be assigned from a file. See example in [Push button](../../wdg/wdg-basic-inputs/#push-button).
