# Chalk'it

Welcome to Chalk'it. Chalk'it ambition is to allow technicians, scientists or engineers, not specialists in web technologies, to build their own web applications based on the Python code, JavaScript code or web-services they develop. Watch this 5 minutes video for a quick introduction: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY8I1XwKs9k> or this more detailed demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2IfRogeCc>. Read this 7 minutes [Medium Story](https://python.plainenglish.io/chalkit-an-open-source-framework-for-python-web-applications-with-drag-drop-and-dataflow-7b4ecc955cca).

Currently, Chalk'it allows to export and share standalone HTML apps with Python and/or JavaScript code, thanks to Pyodide.

See the [demos gallery](https://ifpen.github.io/chalk-it/index.html#porfolio) and [templates gallery](https://ifpen.github.io/chalk-it/templates-gallery/) for examples with code.

For more details, you can browse the online [documentation](https://ifpen.github.io/chalk-it/hosted/doc/)
