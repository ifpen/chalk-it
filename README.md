# Taipy Designer

Welcome to Taipy Designer. Taipy Designer ambition is to allow technicians, scientists or engineers, not specialists in web technologies, to build their own web applications based on the Python code, JavaScript code or web-services they develop.

Taipy Designer is primarily based on [Chalk'it framework](https://github.com/ifpen/chalk-it) from IFPEN. Watch this 5 minutes video for a quick introduction: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY8I1XwKs9k> or this more detailed demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2IfRogeCc>.
