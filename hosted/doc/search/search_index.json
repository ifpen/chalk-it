It also features an intuitive designer dashboards by simple drag&drop. The development of a web-application with Chalk'it is based on the following concepts: Workspace: Concept analogous to the workspace of Matlab or IPython. It contains JSON or Python objects that have a given state and are accessible to other tool entities. DataNode: Concept analogous to a cell of a Notebook Jupyter. It can be seen as a function which should produce a JSON result or a Python object (only for the Pyodide dataNode). DataNodes can also have an execution period. \u201cdataNodes\u201d keyword: Concept for creating a dataflow between dataNodes (aka nodes). It is used inside a script-like DataNode to express a data and execution dependency with a predecessor node. Execution graph: Dependency relationships defined by the \u201cdataNodes\u201d keyword that organize the application logic. User actions on widgets trigger the execution of the concerned dataflow. Widget: Graphic object defined by a rectangle in the HTML page for User interface. It interacts with the workspace via connection points called actuators. Actions are as diverse as clicking a button, entering text or numeric values, scrolling cursors, selecting items from drop-down lists. Widgets allow complex visualizations thanks to the integrated libraries, such as Plotly.js, Charts, Vega (JavaScript) or Plotly and Matplotlib (both Python). Methods for visualizing data on maps based on Leaflet.js are also added. Connection: Notion defining the link between a widget (via its actuator) and a DataNode. Document: JSON document describing the whole working model including the Chalk'it dashboard. The document has the extension xprjson, and is similar to the ipynb format of Jupyter notebooks. Page: The result of the xprjson document is an HTML page that contains the dashboard. This page is the web application. It can be hosted on a static page server and shared thanks to its link to considerably facilitate exchanges. A Chalk'it page is an HTML file which includes the xprjson document file and its associated JavaScript and CSS runtime libraries.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"recipes/","text":"Some useful recipes \u00b6 JavaScript recipes \u00b6 Simple key/value JSON to table (linewise) \u00b6 return [ _ . keys ( dataNodes [ \"vehicle\" ]), _ . values ( dataNodes [ \"vehicle\" ])]; See json-to-table-linewise-js.xprjson Simple key/value JSON to table (columnwise) \u00b6 return _ . unzip ([ _ . keys ( dataNodes [ \"vehicle\" ]), _ . values ( dataNodes [ \"vehicle\" ])]); See json-to-table-columnwise-js.xprjson Read CSV, display content and write it to file \u00b6 See csv-read-write-js.xprjson Plotly \u00b6 x-axis with time \u00b6 See plotly-with-date-time-js.xprjson Read xlsx file from URL and convert it to JSON \u00b6 See xls-from-url-to-json-js.xprjson","title":"Recipes"},{"location":"recipes/#some-useful-recipes","text":"","title":"Some useful recipes"},{"location":"recipes/#javascript-recipes","text":"","title":"JavaScript recipes"},{"location":"recipes/#simple-keyvalue-json-to-table-linewise","text":"return [ _ . keys ( dataNodes [ \"vehicle\" ]), _ . values ( dataNodes [ \"vehicle\" ])]; See json-to-table-linewise-js.xprjson","title":"Simple key/value JSON to table (linewise)"},{"location":"recipes/#simple-keyvalue-json-to-table-columnwise","text":"return _ . unzip ([ _ . keys ( dataNodes [ \"vehicle\" ]), _ . values ( dataNodes [ \"vehicle\" ])]); See json-to-table-columnwise-js.xprjson","title":"Simple key/value JSON to table (columnwise)"},{"location":"recipes/#read-csv-display-content-and-write-it-to-file","text":"See csv-read-write-js.xprjson","title":"Read CSV, display content and write it to file"},{"location":"recipes/#plotly","text":"","title":"Plotly"},{"location":"recipes/#x-axis-with-time","text":"See plotly-with-date-time-js.xprjson","title":"x-axis with time"},{"location":"recipes/#read-xlsx-file-from-url-and-convert-it-to-json","text":"See xls-from-url-to-json-js.xprjson","title":"Read xlsx file from URL and convert it to JSON"},{"location":"xdashapi/","text":"xDashApi \u00b6 xDashApi provides features for building multi-dashboard applications.

DataNode instances are the nodes of a direct acyclic graph where edges are data dependencies. They each own a status describing their latest execution state. Last update time indicates the time of the last successful execution. DataNodes status \u00b6 May have one of the following values : None : execution of the dataNode has not happened yet. Pending : execution of the dataNode is pending. This happens when a web-service call takes some time to complete. OK : last execution of the dataNode has completed sucessfully. Error : last execution has completed with error. Execution rules \u00b6 DataNode is executed if and only if all its predecessors completed their execution with an OK status. Every time a dataNode is succesfully computed (status \"OK\"), it triggers the execution of all its successors. Graph execution is interrupted at dataNodes with an Error status. Their successors are not executed. Schedule instance \u00b6 At first start, graph is scheduled in a breadth-first order starting from source nodes. This is the first schedule instance. Some dataNodes might be updated through different ways : widget value written to dataNode, file imported into dataNode, formula modification, user refresh of dataNode... Such update launches the execution of the corresponding dataNode and a new scheduling instance. Execution flow control parameters \u00b6 The graph execution is controlled by the execution flow control parameters specified in dataNodes. autostart \u00b6 When set to false , the associated dataNode is not executed on first execution of the dashboard nor in subsequent ones. Otherwise, i.e. when set to true , default dataNodes execution behavior applies: all nodes are executed by the Chalk'it runtime when all their predecessors successfully completed. For example, autostart can be set to false to avoid executing a heavy computation web-service at project load. Default value is true. sample time \u00b6 When different from 0, the dataNode is executed every sample time . It's useful for ensuring a periodic real-time execution behavior. Every time a non null sample time is defined, the execution engine computes the greatest common divisor and use it as a its base timer. Sample time is expressed in seconds and must be a multiple of 0.1s. Default value is 0. explicit trig \u00b6 When set to true , the dataNode, in terms of execution flow control, is considered as a source node with autostart set to false . It is no longer executed when a direct predecessor is updated. With this setting, it is only executed when it is explicitly triggered by an associated push button widget or by a click on the dataNode update icon present in the dataNodes list of tabs 1 or 3. Please refer to the Triggered POST example above. Otherwise (i.e. when set to false ), default dataNodes execution behavior applies. Useful for implementing a form-like behavior (setting independently all required dataNode inputs, without executing it with each update, then explicitly triggering its execution). Default value is false. Execution flow control parameters : summary \u00b6 The table below summarizes the execution flow control parameters for the currently available dataNode types in Chalk'it.

In the following, we describe the remaining dataNode types of Chalk'it. Type Variable Python Script (Pyodide) JavaScript Script (client-side) REST web-service Generic text file reader Generic binary file reader CSV file reader CSV file player Geolocation Clock Delay MQTT WebSocket receive WebSocket send Python script (Pyodide) \u00b6 It allows the evaluation of a Python script in client-side using Pyodide . Executed Python code may use the librairies available for installation in the Project librairies main tab. For further information, please read the Client-side execution with Pyodide section under Chalk'it Python Management . Some examples: formula-py.xprjson rest-pandas-pyodide-covid.xprjson plotly-python-widget-py.xprjson JavaScript Script \u00b6 Similar to Python Script-type dataNodes, it is possible to write JavaScript code referencing other dataNodes, and producing JSON output to the workspace. All JavaScript librairies loaded by Chalk'it are available for use. The following ones are particularly of interest: Underscore.js Turf.js d3.js geoConversion gpx.js jQuery leaflet PapaParse SweetAlert Simple example : formula-js.xprjson REST web-services \u00b6 The dataNode type REST Web-service is used to call functions exposed as REST web-services . Input arguments may come from Chalk'it workspaces (referenced using keyword dataNodes ). The response is then evaluated in the workspace, if the call was successful. Typically, the information required to write the dataNode comes from the web-service API documentation. It may use Swagger . Parameters \u00b6 URL \u00b6 The URL of the HTTP request. The following examples illustrate Chalk'it syntax for path and how to use code to modify query arguments passed in URL. xProxy \u00b6 xProxy concept was inspired by ThingProxy . It allows to overcome web-browser CORS (Cross-Origin Resources issues) restrictions. As Chalk'it runs on a web-browser, it is subject to browser's CORS policy. Please disable xProxy if you call a localhost or private network webservice. Some examples \u00b6 Simple GET \u00b6 webservice-get.xprjson : this is a simple GET example with no input arguments. Simple POST \u00b6 webservice-post-simple-js.xprjson : this is a simple POST example with body as a JSON. GET with arguments \u00b6 webservice-get-args-js.xprjson : this example illustrates a GET call where arguments (custom path and query arguments) are defined using the urlAppend object in the body field. GET with arguments from another dataNode \u00b6 webservice-get-input-py.xprjson and webservice-get-input-js.xprjson : in this example, two variables defined in a variable dataNode are used as inputs to the GET web-service call. GET of a binary file \u00b6 xls-from-url-to-json-py.xprjson : an excel file is read from a remote URL and its content displayed. POST with arguments from another dataNode \u00b6 webservice-post-input-py.xprjson and webservice-post-input-js.xprjson : in this example, two variables defined in a variable dataNode are used as inputs to the POST web-service call. Triggered POST \u00b6 webservice-post-input-triggered-py.xprjson and webservice-post-input-triggered-js.xprjson : if the explicit trigger option is checked, the dataNode is only executed when an explicit click is performed (using a connected push button widget or the update button). When predecessors change, the dataNode execution is no longer triggered. This feature is useful for building form-like interfaces. See also Execution flow control parameters CSV file reader \u00b6 Reads a CSV file and translates its content to JSON, according to the value of ROW TO ARRAY property : If set to true , each row of the CSV file will be placed into a JavaScript Array. See example: csv-array.xprjson Otherwise, if set to false , content is parsed as an array of JSON objects. See example: csv-json.xprjson The following CSV: \"lat\",\"lng\",\"CH4\" 48.876684, 2.175765, 1.94 48.876684, 2.175765, 1.95 48.876684, 2.175765, 1.92 48.876705, 2.175806, 1.93 48.876705, 2.175806, 1.99 when ROW TO ARRAY is true , is translated to: { \"lat\" : [ 48.876684 , 48.876684 , 48.876684 , 48.876705 , 48.876705 ], \"lng\" : [ 2.175765 , 2.175765 , 2.175765 , 2.175806 , 2.175806 ], \"CH4\" : [ 1.94 , 1.95 , 1.92 , 1.93 , 1.99 ] } otherwise, it is translated to: [ { \"lat\" : 48.876684 , \"lng\" : 2.175765 , \"CH4\" : 1.94 }, { \"lat\" : 48.876684 , \"lng\" : 2.175765 , \"CH4\" : 1.95 }, { \"lat\" : 48.876684 , \"lng\" : 2.175765 , \"CH4\" : 1.92 }, { \"lat\" : 48.876705 , \"lng\" : 2.175806 , \"CH4\" : 1.93 }, { \"lat\" : 48.876705 , \"lng\" : 2.175806 , \"CH4\" : 1.99 } ] An example of table display of this CSV file is given here: csv-array-table-display.xprjson . It combines a CSV file reader as well as a formula using the underscore.js library . CSV file player \u00b6 Acts as a player of CSV file. Its behaviour depends on the TIME INCLUDED parameter: If set to false , play starts from the first row. On each SAMPLING TIME , the current row is output in JSON format and the pointer moves to the next row. See example csv-player.xprjson . Otherwise (i.e. TIME INCLUDED ), the first row is considered as a time vector. Delay \u00b6 Applies a one-step delay to its input defined in the INPUT SIGNAL field. On the first execution, its output is set to the JSON value defined in the INIT VALUE field. Example with Clock and Delay : clock-and-delay.xprjson . Clock \u00b6 Gets the value of the JavaScript clock from the web-browser which is running the Chalk'it app: { \"numeric_value\" : 1556898500713 , \"full_string_value\" : \"03/05/2019 \u00e0 17:48:20\" , \"date_string_value\" : \"03/05/2019\" , \"time_string_value\" : \"17:48:20\" , \"date_object\" : \"2019-05-03T15:48:20.713Z\" } Example with Clock and Delay : clock-and-delay.xprjson . Geolocation \u00b6 This dataNode gets the current geographical position of the device, using the GPS sensors if available. For privacy reasons, authorization is requested from the user to report its position. It also requires Chalk'it to operate under the https protocole. DataNode produces the following output. Its output value is updated automatically according to the device position and movement. Example with Geolocation dataNode and Leaflet Maps widget which displays your location : osm-geojson-geolocation.xprjson . WebSocket \u00b6 These dataNodes offers support for the WebSocket protocol , which is supported by most web browsers to offert real-time data exchange capabilities. It provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. WebSocket in Chalk'it is implemented as client. It needs to communicate with remote WebSocket server. WebSocket receive \u00b6 Acts as a WebSocket client receiver for Chalk'it. Remote IP address : The IP address or host name for your remote WebSocket sender. Remote IP port : The port to connect to your WebSocket sender. Initialization token : Keep to None for most applications. None : nothing is sent to the web server during initialization of exchange. xMOD : support to xMOD software. The token \"ws_init\" is sent once to the xMOD WebSocket server during initialisation of exchange. Decoding options : decoding options applied on response data sent by your WebSocket sender. options Description JSON Received data are in JSON format Int8Array Received data are an Array of integer 1 byte Uint8Array Received data are an Array of unsigned integer 1 byte Int16Array Received data are an Array of integer 16 bits Uint16Array Received data are an Array of unsigned integer 16 bits Int32Array Received data are an Array of integer 32 bits Uint32Array Received data are an Array of unsigned integer 32 bits Float32Array Received data are an Array of float 32 bits (IEEE 754 single precision) Float64Array Received data are an Array of float 64 bits (IEEE 754 double precision) ArrayBuffer2String Received data are an Javascript ArrayBuffer and transform to string inside Chalk'it WebSocket send \u00b6 Acts as a WebSocket client sender for Chalk'it. JSON/JAVASCRIPT INPUT : The data sent by this dataNode to the WebSocket receiver . Data are sent without any modification. In the following example, the dataNode reads the value of \"Item\" property from the \"SelectedCmd\" dataNode and send this value to the remote WebSocket receiver as a 32-bit float.

It consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The Iris dataset is widely used in machine learning as a benchmark dataset for statistical classification algorithms. It is free and publicly avaible at the UCI Machine Repository . The following tutorial allows to illustrate main Chalk'it features througth this dataset. Expected result is provided in the following project: iris-tutorial.xprjson 1. Create a projet \u00b6 Run Chalk'it in the command line: chalk-it Then, click My Project button to reach project editor on the Discover Chalk'it menu. Name the new projet iris-tutorial by filling the title form, then save it using the Save button. An iris-tutorial.xprjson is then created in your current directory (directory where the chalk-it command was run). 2. Load required Python Pyodide librairies \u00b6 Using the Project librairies main tab, load the following required librairies: pandas , scikit-learn (from the Standard Librairies tabset) and plotly (from the Micropip Librairies tabset). Use the search bar to ease the process. 3. Load dataset data \u00b6 Create a datanode named dataset to load the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn by following the next instructions: Click on Datanodes main tab, then on New button: Select Script (Pyodide) from the list of datanode types: Enter dataset in the NAME field and copy the following code into the PYTHON SCRIPT field: from sklearn import datasets iris = datasets . load_iris () return iris This step is illustrated below: Finally, click on Save button for validation. Datanode execution status and result are now available and can be previewed in the dataset window as follows: 4. Visualize the dataset \u00b6 Visualize the dataset in 4 steps: Step1: prepare the data \u00b6 To load the dataset in a Pandas dataframe, follow the procedure described in paragraph 2. to create a new Script (Pyodide) datanode. The main differences are: Enter datasetDataframe in NAME field, Copy the following code in PYTHON SCRIPT field. import pandas as pd iris = dataNodes [ \"dataset\" ] df = pd . DataFrame ( data = iris . data , columns = iris . feature_names ) df [ \"target\" ] = iris . target target_names = { 0 : \"Setosa\" , 1 : \"Versicolour\" , 2 : \"Virginica\" } df [ 'target' ] = df [ 'target' ] . map ( target_names ) return df The expression dataNodes[\"dataset\"] indicates Chalk'it to read the last execution output of the dataset datanode. It also establishes a data and execution flow dependency between dataset and datasetDataframe . To visualize the dataset using Plotly Python librairy, create a new Script (Pyodide) datanode, name it plot , then copy the following code in PYTHON SCRIPT field. import plotly.express as px df = dataNodes [ \"datasetDataframe\" ] fig = px . scatter ( df , x = \"sepal width (cm)\" , y = \"sepal length (cm)\" , color = \"target\" , size = 'petal length (cm)' , hover_data = [ 'petal width (cm)' ]) return fig Step2: create the dashboard \u00b6 To browse the widgets libraries, click on Widgets main tab, then open the Plots category as shown below: To add a Plotly Python widget to the dashboard editor, click on the corresponding icon or just perform a drag and drop. Step3: connect dataNode to widget \u00b6 Click on the pencil icon on the top-right corner of the widget to display the widget menu. Select then Connect widget as shown below: A panel will then be displayed on the right-side of the screen. From the connection dropdown, select the datanode plot , as it will provide the figure object needed for the widget. Click Save to validate the choice. Step4: Preview the dashboard \u00b6 A static preview of the figure is then provided. The widget can be moved or resized as needed. The *View* mode can be selected to start interactive visualization. 5. Interactive predictor with classifier training \u00b6 The goal is now to use the previously trained classifier to predict Iris species based on petal and sepal width and length. Classifier training \u00b6 Following the steps already described in paragraph 2. , create a Script (Pyodide) datanode named classifier and use the following python script as shown in the picture below. from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier clf = RandomForestClassifier () clf . fit ( dataNodes [ \"dataset\" ] . data , dataNodes [ \"dataset\" ] . target ) return clf The result should look like: Interactive predictor \u00b6 Create a JSON Variable datanode named inputs using JavaScript workspace variable type. Use the following JSON definition: { \"sepal_width\" : 5.4 , \"sepal_length\" : 2.7 , \"petal_length\" : 3 , \"petal_width\" : 0.5 } The result should be as follow: Add four horizontal sliders to pilot the values of \"sepal width\",\"sepal_length\", \"petal_length\" and \"petal_width\". First click the _Widgets main tab, then basic inputs & controls .

Leaflet maps \u00b6 Leaflet maps widget has rich and versatile features for displaying various information on maps. It also has selection and interaction features. It is based on Leaflet library and its various plugins. When a new Leaflet maps widget is added to the dashboard, only one actuator named geoJSON1 is available in the \"Data connection\" tab. But this widget allows up to 5 types of display layers, according to the value of the associated parameter numberOfLayers . This parameter can be set in the \"Graphical properties\" tab as shown in the following picture: Depending on the parametrization, new actuators may appear in \"Data connection\" tab and offer : 0 to 8 possible layers of GeoJSON objects. Writing GeoJSON objects is described here . 0 to 8 possible layers of heatMap objects 0 to 8 possible layers of lineHeatMap objects 0 to 8 possible layers of choropleth objects 0 to 8 possible layer of imageOverlay objects 0 to 8 possible layer of svgOverlay objects In addition to these pure display layers, selection controls can be activated by enabling the drawingFeatures option. Regions of the map can thus be selected using the mouse. When this option is enabled, the selectedGeoJson actuator receives user selection as geoJson, and needs to be connected to a variable -type dataNode. This features are based on the Geoman plugin. Enabling the drawingFeatures option enables the drawingFeaturesOptions parameters set which manages selection options (point, line, polygone, rectangle). Other parameters : offlineSupport : displays controls on the maps that allow to store tiles for the current displayed geographic area. Useful when using the map offline (i.e. with no Internet connection) tileServer : currently there is support for MapboxStreets and HereHybridDay geoJson layers \u00b6 geoJson1 to geoJson8 inputs expect a geoJson object.

Example : osm-drawing-features.xprjson Folium Maps \u00b6 Folium is a Python library used for visualizing geospatial data. It leverages the power of the Leaflet.js library and provides a simple way to create interactive maps. Folium can be used to create various types of maps such as choropleth maps, bubble maps, and scatter maps, and provides an easy-to-use interface for adding markers, popups, and other interactive features to the maps. Folium is built on top of the Python data analysis library pandas, which makes it easy to manipulate and visualize large datasets. It also supports several tilesets such as OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, which can be used to customize the look and feel of the maps. Usage examples: folium-point.xprjson Address autocompletion \u00b6 This widget uses the here geocoder autocomplete API to provide suggestion as the user types an address location.

Otherwise, use the Plotly generic for a complete Plotly.js options and configurations Plotly.js-based widgets share common parameters, especially hideModeBar which allows to hide plot options toolbar at dashboard play. Plotly line \u00b6 Allows to quickly display line charts, when x and y axis are expressed as arrays of numbers. The parameter numberOfAxis allows to specifiy up to 8 y-axis actuators (named y1 to y8 ), sharing the same x-axis actuator (named x ). Widget layout may be configured in the \"Graphical properties\" tab. line-chart.xprjson Plotly bar \u00b6 Here parameter numberOfAxis allows to specify couples of x and y axis actuators (named x1 , y1 to x8 , y8 ). Some examples : bar-chart.xprjson stack-bar-chart-js.xprjson Plotly pie \u00b6 This widget has two actuators : values : an array of values to be displayed as pie chart labels : an optional array of labels associated to values Example : pie-chart.xprjson Plotly 3D surface \u00b6 This widget has three actuators : x : 1-D numeric array of size N y : 1-D numeric array of size M z : 2-D numeric array (an M -size array of N -size arrays) Example : 3d-surface.xprjson Plotly Real-time \u00b6 The widget provides a real-time graph for displaying numeric-based dataNode inputs, having a given sample-time. Example : real-time-kpi-plotly-js.xprjson Plotly JavaScript generic \u00b6 This widget accepts three actuators : data , layout and selection . In opposite to previous Plotly-based widgets, layout cannot be set from \"Graphical properties\" tab. This brings more expressive power for layout specification using programming dataNodes. Defining data and layout is illustrated in plotly.js documentation . Some examples: bubble-chart-js.xprjson plotly-stat-box-js.xprjson The selection actuator is detailed in this topic Plotly Python Generic \u00b6 This widget expects a Plotly figure Python object, produced by a Python Script (Pyodide) -type dataNode.

With Plotly JavaScript generic graph, the Chalk'it platform gives you access to selected events which contain all fields necessary in order to use selected element in the dataflow (transfer selection to another graph, filter data according to selection, ...) For those familiar with Plotly select events, \"appendix I\" will explain how xDash selection events are created. main data and global index \u00b6 When user wants to create a graph from a selection of another graph, or to transfer the selection from one graph to another (or from one graph to a script), there is a logic of a main shared data. This could be the result of a CSV import, a global JSON or GeoJSON. This shared data is considered and referenced as the global data in our exemples and will be present in the dataNode [data]. Each global shared data is indexed (In the CSV exemple, the index is the lane of each datum) and we will use the term \"global index\" as a generic expression to reference this main indexation. How to use the selection from a graph to draw another one \u00b6 First example : selection-example-1.xprjson In this first exemple we : Plot all data in one scatter plot graph (Plotly Generic) Recover the selection from the scatter Build an histogram using only the selected data The main data is an array of datum that each contains 3 values [Alpha, Beta, Delta]. Typically obtained from a CSV import. The cross plot will be done between [alpha vs beta] and [delta] will be used to draw the histogram. The dataFlow contains 5 dataNodes and 2 associated widgets One DataNode that contains the global data. Two DataNodes are created for each Plotly Graph (data and layout) One DataNode which contains the selection One widget [plotly generic] is the scatter plot One widget [plotly generic] is the histogram The data for the Plotly histogram is dependant of the selection DataNode. The graphs and DataNodes associated (PloltlyData and PlotlyLayout) dont know each others and dont have direct relationship. In order to have a clean change in the histogram, the X axis limit and bin limits are defined via all the data. How to draw a graph with different sources of selection \u00b6 Now, lets imagine that what you want to draw is defined by the addition of different incoming selections. Example 2: selection-example-2.xprjson In Exemple 2 We draw 2 scatter plots Both selection are used to draw the histogram. This exemple is similar than the last one except that : the selection datanode has now one field for each cross plot selection one dataNode is now present to process the selection [MultiSelectionProcess] The process node does the addition of each selection. The structure of the selection node has changed, there is now one field for each graph which will aggregate their selection. Each selection actuator from the cross plot now is now linked with one field of the selection node. It is relevant that the code of the process DataNode dont know the number and the origin of each incoming selections. You can so add and remove origin of selection without changing the code of the process datanode The PlotlyData datanode used for the histogram takes information from the process node. A datanode is used to collect information and create the \"global\" selection. This is not done in the datanode used for plotly data. This global selection could be used for other graphs or script without copy/paste. How to synchronize selection to have a single global selection \u00b6 The different selection on each graph are independant. In some case we want a \"global\" selection\" which regroup all selection and that all graph show the selected data. Example 3 selection-example-3.xprjson In this exemple we do 2 scatter plots from the same global data. As exemple 2, we use a process node to concatenate the information but on both graphs we want to see all the selected data. Plotly graphs are mainly correlated with their own selection. Trying to use the \"selectedpoints\" field present in plotly data is a bad idea. This fied is ok if the graph dont has his own selection behavior. But this field is erased when using \"rectangle\" or \"lasso\" selection. It is better to consider external selection as a complement of the possible present selection. \"appendix II\" will enter deeper in exposing the selection The additional selected items are not drawn last, so we see clearly a difference between the selection from the graph and the selection from other sources. In next exemple we propose a solution to handle this. How to use the selection event if the index selected are different from the data index \u00b6 Example 4: * selection-example-4.xprjson For the moment, in the different exemples we have assumed that the [index] given by the selection is the same that the index of the data. It means that if the data selected is \"4\" it is the same index on the global data index. But it is not always the case, for multiple reasons, the index given by the selection could be different, for exemple you need to draw only a part of the data you need to sort the data X vs Y in order to draw a line you need to sort the global data before drawing in order to control the Z order of the draw ... Each plotly trace contains a [customdata] field that can help us to resolve this problem In exemple [nom de l'exemple] we used the same But in the data for plotly DataNode we order the drawn order with all selected data at the end. it is not possible to give a drawn order to plotly (V2.16.3). The element and the trace are drawn in the order given by the user. Last element of last trace are drawn last. In the data for plotly Datanode we sort the element but we keep the change in an array called \"orderForGraph\" which will be transfer to plotly in the \"customdata\" field. This field is present in the selection of the dataflow and can be used in the selectionProcess node to obtain the equivalent index. Create a reset selection action \u00b6 Example 5: * selection-example-5.xprjson in our exemple, selection is in an independant DataNode, and no more only a graphical features. In order to reset the selection, we need to clean all the DataFlow and all the graphics. In exemple 5 we create a reset selection script which is triggered by a push button. 3 significant addition in the dataNode have to be done in order to have a clean result. Reset the DataNode [Selection] via the xDashApi function. This will reset the selection and the plotly data (done in [ResetSelection] dataNode) Add the field \"selections : []\" in all layout impacted in order to remove all the visible rectangle or lasso drawn Create a relation between the resetSelection action script and the different layout to trigger the layout dataNodes. Good Practices \u00b6 Create one datanode for the layout and one for the data \u00b6 If one dataNode is used to give the Data and the Layout for the widget, some unexpected graphical behavior can happen. Usually data often change according to action, but user like to keep element of visualisation (zoom, factor, element selected, ... ) When data changed, plotly will also reset the layout if they are in the same datanode, which can change your view according to what is defined in the original layout. Never use the same layout DataNode for multiple graphs. \u00b6 Plotly keeps in memory each layout for its own internal use. It never makes copy. If the same layout is used for exemple for 2 scatter plots each pan/zoom/selection done on one plot ... will be passed to the other graph but not at the same time. The repercution will be done next time plotly via the dataFlow needs to check the current layout. And you dont know when it will happens (often when the widget is selected) <<<<<<< HEAD:documentation/docs/wdg/selection/plot-selection.md Appendix 1 : Plotly Selection and Chalk'it Selection \u00b6 ======= Appendix 1 : Plotly Selection and xDash Selection \u00b6 master:HowTos/docs/wdg/selection/plot-selection.md Structures of the plotly selection are discribe in https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data So plotly selection events are dependant from the kind of the original graph (2D, 3D, map, ...)

The behavior you need can visualy enter in \"conflict\" with plotly internal behavior, or can provoke non wanted behaviors. When you draw a selection via plotly, each attributes dont used the standard fields (color, size, ...) but used the fields that are under the 2 fields \"selected\" and \"unselected\" .. and this is true only for plotly graph which accept this fields; \"selected\" and \"unselected\" are used by plotly when - a \"rectangle\" selection is done - a \"lasso\" selection is done - if the field \"selectionpoints\" is given as a plotly data In those cases, data are divided in two groups (selected and unselected) and are drawn according to these fields. If you dont define them, plotly used internal behavior to create them (mainly reducing the tone and the opacity) the \"regular\" way (for exemple [data][marker] in scatter plot) to render graph are no more used when graph is in selection mode. A \"rectangle\" or \"lasso\" selection reset the field \"selectionpoints\" In exemple 3 and 4 we want to keep the plotly behavior for drawing and moving selection, but we also want to keep the way we draw things.
